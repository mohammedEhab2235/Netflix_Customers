**Recommendations**

1.	**Focus on High-LTV Countries:**

•	The United States and Spain have the highest total LTVs. Consider targeted marketing and retention strategies in these countries to maximize revenue.

•	France and the United Kingdom, with the highest average LTVs, should also be prioritized for premium offerings and upsell opportunities.

2.	**Gender-Specific Campaigns:**

•	The gender distribution is nearly equal across all countries. Tailor marketing campaigns to address the preferences and needs of both male and female users equally.

•	Utilize the balanced gender ratio to create inclusive content and promotions that appeal to a wide audience.

3.	**Device Optimization:**

•	With a relatively even distribution of devices used by subscribers (Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones, Smart TVs), ensure that the platform is optimized for all these devices.

•	Develop device-specific features or promotions to enhance user experience and engagement.

4.	**Subscription Type Promotions:**

•	The Basic subscription type has the highest number of users. Consider introducing features or benefits to encourage upgrades to Standard or Premium plans.

•	Implement targeted promotions to highlight the value of higher-tier subscriptions to Basic plan users.

5.	**Future Analysis**:

•	Conduct deeper analyses on user behavior, content preferences, and churn rates to refine marketing and retention strategies.

•	Explore geographical trends and regional preferences to tailor content and offerings to different markets.
